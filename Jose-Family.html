      <li><h3>My Family</h3></li>
      <li><p>My family consists of my mother, my aunt, and my grandfather. They have all played important roles in my life, and continue to support me in everything I do. I never got to experience having a father, but my mom has always done her best in giving me the best life possible. I cherish everything they do for me, from the amazing birthday parties, to all the privledges they give me. I couldn't have asked for a better family, nor would I want to change anything in the current one I have right now. I hope my family will continue supporting me as I get closer to my future goals and dreams.</p></li>
