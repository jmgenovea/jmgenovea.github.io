      <li><h3>Korean Pop Music: "Kpop"</h3></li>
      <li><p>Korean Music has been one of my go to's when listening to music. The unique vibe it gives really brings out the best in me. I was informed about Kpop when one of my friends introduced me to Super Junior's song, Sorry Sorry. Ever since then, I was hooked onto the genre of music. The artist I currently enjoy listening to is, BTS, or Bangtan Boy Scouts. They are an up and coming group that really motivates me to push my goals when listening to their music.</p></li>

    <li><p>Computers have played such a critical role on my life, and I've always enjoyed what they did. Building and fixing computers have always been one of my favorite things to do, and I have thought about making it a possible major. I remember building my first computer last year, and how fun it was putting the pieces together.</p></li>
