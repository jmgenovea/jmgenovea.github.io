      <li><p>The way this page was created was through HTML coding. HTML stands for Hyper Text Makeup Language and is used to create what we know as webpages today. Today's current standard version of HTML is HTML5. The coding has different classes and IDs you can assign to each variant of tags. This page mainly utilized what is know as the div tag. The div tag is similar to a folder that allows you to change everything inside of it by only changing the properties of the div tag. However, you can also change what is inside as well as change the div properties. There is also what is known as the CSS which is used to change those tag properties. A CSS is known as the Cascading Styling Sheets. This is used externally compared to the HTML, but you can embed style inside your HTML or use what is know as in-line styling.</p></li>
