      <li><h3>Super Smash Bros. for Wii U</h3></li>
      <li><p>One of my favorite hobbies is to play Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. It is a staple fighting game that has nintendo characters duke it out in various battlefields. The game can support up to 8 players and you can play with people online from all around the world. I took interest in the series ever since the first iteration of the game was released in 1999. Smash bros. is also played competitively, having a vast field of strong players worldwide. A couple friends and I like to take the opportunity in playing this game competitively as it brings a unique vibe to it. If you would like to learn more about the scene, click <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros" target="_blank">here.</a></p></li>

    <li><h3 style="text-align:right">Building Model Kits: Gundam Kits</h3></li>
    <li><p>Ever since I was a child, my mom got me my first Gundam model, and I've been hooked on them. Gundam is an anime series about robotics that people can pilot. The series has branched into multiple figurines, and various video games. I collect only the best quality Gundam models because of my love for the unique anime. There are tons of rare model kits that are on bidding sites such as eBay where you can find them. If you would like to check them out, click <a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/Gundam-Models-Kits/16513/bn_1919345/i.html" target="_blank">here.</a></p></li>
